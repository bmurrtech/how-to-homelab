# JupyterLab Setup

### Provision JupyterLab
> This guide assumes you are have a Proxmox hypervisor already configured to spin up new VMs, but you could create with a VPS, [Docker](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and more!

- Create an Ubuntu VM to host your Jupyter Lab

> I went with an Ubuntu Desktop, but you could use [Ubuntu 22.04 server on a baremetal server VPS](https://docs.vultr.com/how-to-set-up-a-jupyterlab-environment-on-ubuntu-22-04) for example (just take special note of the the `virtualenv` section if you go the server route). If you choose to go with an Unbuntu server, deploy using my using [cloud-init guide](https://github.com/bmurrtech/how-to-homelab/blob/main/how-to_ultimate_proxmox.md#cloud-init-template) (much faster deployment, trust me, it's worth setting up in Proxmox!). 

### JupyterLab `pip` Install Method
> Jupyter Lab KB ref.: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html

- Open a terminal and run:
```
pip install jupyterlab
```

### Start JupyterLab
- In a terminal window run:

```
jupyter lab
```
- JupyterLab will open automatically in your browser.

- The default workspace is in the main `/lab` URL: `http(s)://<server:port>/<lab-location>/lab`

### Set Your Wokring Directory
> JupyterLab's suggests: "If your notebook files are not in the current directory, you can pass your working directory path as argument when starting JupyterLab. Avoid running it from your root volume (e.g. C:\ on Windows or / on Linux) to limit the risk of modifying system files."

- Set you preferred directory
```
#Windows Example
jupyter lab --notebook-dir=E:/ --preferred-dir E:/Documents/Somewhere/Else
#Linux Example
jupyter lab --notebook-dir=/var/ --preferred-dir /var/www/html/example-app/
```

# GitHub in JupyterLab

### Install Git with `pip`

- To install, open a terminal and enter:

```
pip install --upgrade jupyterlab jupyterlab-git
```

- After the command runs, simply close the JupyterLab from the browser tab and re-run the following in terminal to relaunch:

```
jupyter lab
```

- End result: You should now see the "Git" tab and icon in your JupyterLab environment.

### Create New Repository

- Login to your GitHub account: https://github.com/login
- Create a new Repository in your Github

- Copy the URL of the Repository (i.e. https://github.com/bmurrtech/100-days-of-python)
- Click the folder icon and navigate to the directory you wish to clone your repo to on your VM.
- Click the GitHub icon (left) and choose "Clone Repository"

### Push Changes to GitHub

- Right-click the files you wish to push to the master: Right-click > "Track"

- Enter a comment of the changes made

- Enter your name as the contributure (email and name are optional, but hepful if working with team)
- Once you have pushed the changes, you'll see a red notification buble on the GitHub upload cloud icon. Click it to push your changes to GitHub.

- You will now be prompted to input your GitHub username and a password/access token. For the fun of it, I created a token specific for my new JupyterLab.

### Create a GitHub Access token
- Naviage to: GitHub > Settings (click on you profile icon) > Developer Settings (at the very bottom) > Personal Access Tokens > Fine-grained tokens (Beta) > Generate New Token (button)
- Follow the GitHub guides on how to configure your tokens:
    - [Creating a new token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
    - Read up on [GitHub permissions](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens) (if you care about that)
- Copy the new token and paste it 

### Initialize a Repository to GitHub

- Create a new folder at `/your/path/`

- Create a new notebook (Python3) by right-clicking and selecting New Notebook.

- Rename your notebook (right-click > rename)
- Enter some placeholder text/code you push to your GitHub (testing purposes).

- Initialize this as a Repository: Git (tab) > Initialize a Repository
